## Lower the temperature
By default, the long term TDP is set to 8 watt, you can lower it to 7 watt to maintain the temp below 80c. Also, offset the cpu voltage by 115mv also help cool the device.
```
sudo ./voltageshift buildlaunchd -115 0 0 0 0 0 7 28 18 0.002 60
```
You can remove this by using:
```
./voltageshift removelaunchd
```
Or manual remove by:
 ```
sudo rm /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.sicreative.VoltageShift.plist
sudo rm -R /Library/Application\ Support/VoltageShift
```
Please notice if you cannot boot the system after installing, you need to:
1. Fully turn off Computer (not reboot):
2. Boot start by Command-R to recovery mode :
3. In "Terminal" Enable the CSR protection to stop undervoltage running when boot 
```
csrutil enable    
```
4. Reboot and Remove all file above
