## Turn off BD PROCHOT
It's very weird that BD PROCHOT will kick in even at 60 ~ 70c. When it kick in, the cpu will die to 0.4Ghz and become a holy crap. So it's better to turn it off to get a better performance.

You can use the DisablePROCHOT.efi file in EFI/OC/Drivers to turn off it. After turnning it off, if the cpu continues to be fully loaded, the temperature may rise to near 90c. Beyond 90c, the device will become unstable, it will either auto power off or crash. So you should also do the following step to lower the temperature.

## Lower the temperature
By default, the long term TDP is set to 8 watt, you can lower it to 7 watt to maintain the temp below 80c. Also, offset the cpu voltage by 115mv also help cool the device.
```
sudo ./voltageshift buildlaunchd -115 0 0 0 0 0 7 28 18 0.002 60
```
You can remove this by using:
```
./voltageshift removelaunchd
```
Or manual remove by:
 ```
sudo rm /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.sicreative.VoltageShift.plist
sudo rm -R /Library/Application\ Support/VoltageShift
```
Please notice if you cannot boot the system after installing, you need to:
1. Fully turn off Computer (not reboot):
2. Boot start by Command-R to recovery mode :
3. In "Terminal" Enable the CSR protection to stop undervoltage running when boot 
```
csrutil enable    
```
4. Reboot and Remove all file above
